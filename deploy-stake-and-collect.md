### Step3

Since this store has no money inside of it, we need to copy the wallet address which can be found under the qrcode.

### Step6

If we exit the store after the transaction, we can now observe that the store has 30 available funds and 70 stake. Since we have 70 aUSDC stake, we can accept up to 1000 USDC in payments.
