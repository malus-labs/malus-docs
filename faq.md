As long as someone is selling something, you are able to purchase it.

## What can I sell using Malus?

Any good or service you are giving discounts one is fair game. Take advantage of the protocol to save money that you are losing to attract customers. As long as you are not selling anything illegal, you should be fine. In addition, please ensure that the items you are selling the cashback rate can cover the transaction gas fees. 

## What if my customers don't return with mUSDC?

Let's say you are giving a 7% discount on to attract customers. If someone pays you $93, you are losing $7 on the actual item. The reality is that there is no way to regain that $7. However, by having 7 aUSDC locked as collateral, even if you don't get replayed, you are still gaining interest on your money. Eventually, this would cover the $7 you would have lost. You would also have the ability to sell your collateral at a lost if you really need the money. 

## What is the minimum and maximum amount I can spend?

This all depends on two factors which are the gas fees and the amount staked. An average $10 gas fee for stablecoin transfers on Ethereum could allow you to spend a minimum of 215 USDC and receive 15 mUSDC. As for the maximum, there is no limit. As long as a seller has enough aUSDC stake, your cashback purchase will be covered.
